# Quest : Shark Attacks (Week 2 Mini Project)

Welcome to the Data Wrangling Quest! Our mission: to clean a messy data set known as “Shark Attacks” through using data wrangling techniques. By doing so we will be able to prepare the data set for analysis for a use case of our choice : we're the tourism board of Florida and we're trying to create a new safety outreach.
